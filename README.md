# Cell-Broadcast-Bench-Front-End

# Description
Cell Broadcast Bench is a product to providing e-communicate. Data, which's given by user,'s sended from somewhere to other where with using moduls.
It has options such as 2G, 3G, 3G,which each  have different inputs. Generally, Cell Broadcast Bench is used for e-communicate, but this project more local than I told.
This project's purpose is taking data that's sended using moduls, then insert this data to database, that's why this project is divided into two sub-discipline such as 
Front-End and Back-End. We're going to interest in Front-End.
Cell Broadcast Bench has four interfaces as home, 2G, 3G, 4G. Each interface has own input and design.
